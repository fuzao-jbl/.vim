# vim
The following repository has the configurations I like for my vim. Most of it I have copied from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/
and the colorscheme is from challenger-deep.

All files are infact hidden, so you need to rewrite the vimrc file to .vimrc and vim folder to .vim. Also, the plugins I like to use, ALE and Nerdtree need to be installed. For that you can follow the instructions from the site above.
